        <p>
          I am currently finishing up my senior year at the University of Michigan's
          School of Information. I have greatly enjoyed my schoolwork and am well prepared
          to start my career in User Experience (UX) Design. As of right now, I am in
          the process of searching for a job and am excited for my professional career to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in school, I also worked part time as a Web Content Intern for Michigan Engineering's Communications and Marketing Department.
          In this role, I got lots of experience designing web pages, conducting user research, conducting
          quality analyses, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work and school, I love to be outside. I am an avid runner and love adventures
          of all kind. Additionally, I love to read, write, listen to podcasts, draw, and play video games.
          I am looking forward to having more time to do all of these things once I graduate!
